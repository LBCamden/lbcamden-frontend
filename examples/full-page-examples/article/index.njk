      <p>A deed poll is a legal document that binds an individual to a particular course of action. The most common
        use
        of a deed poll is to change a name. A deed poll commits you to the following actions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to renounce and abandon the use of your former name(s)</li>
        <li>to use your new name(s) at all times</li>
        <li>requires everybody to address you only by your new name(s)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Adults</h3>

      <p>Anyone over the age of 16 can change their name by deed poll. If you are aged over 16 years but not yet 18
        years old, the process is the same as it is for an adult. You do not need the consent of whoever has parental
        responsibility for you. Please <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/">book an appointment</a> and come with relevant ID and a witness.</p>

      <h3>Children</h3>

      <p>A person who has parental responsibility must apply for the name change on behalf of the child. Camden only
        completes a deed poll service where all parents mentioned on a birth certificate (or organisations) that have
        parental rights and responsibilities over the child are able to attend and agree to the name change.&nbsp;Please
        book an appointment and come with relevant ID and a witness.</p>

      <h2>When&nbsp;would I need to use a deed poll?</h2>

      <p>For most purposes a deed poll will be accepted to change documents, but there are some important exceptions.
        Birth and marriage certificates cannot be changed. However, your deed poll together with your birth
        certificate
        will be sufficient for the passport office to issue you with a passport in the new name.&nbsp;<br> If the
        purpose of your deed poll is to alter a particular document it is important to check first with the issuer
        that
        a change will be allowed.</p>

      <h2>What about my name can I change?</h2>

      <h3>You can:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>change your entire name</li>
        <li>add or remove surnames, forenames and middle names</li>
        <li>rearrange your names</li>
        <li>alter spellings of names</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        It can take up to 8 weeks to register a lasting power of attorney if there are no mistakes in the application.
      </div>

      <p>Although the possibilities are almost limitless there are some basic conditions that your new name will have
        to
        meet. On the whole these restrictions are to ensure that you will not have problems when changing documents
        such
        as your passport.</p>
      <p>We will not accept names in the following circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the name is offensive.</li>
        <li>If the name is impossible to pronounce.</li>
        <li>If the name contains numbers, symbols or punctuation marks. &nbsp;Apostrophes are accepted in the context
          of
          a name (such as O’Neill) as are hyphens to link two names together (such as Smith-Johnson).
        </li>
        <li>Recognized accents are accepted, but be aware that the use of accents in the UK is not widespread and
          confusion can arise if they are inconsistently used.
        </li>
        <li>The name must contain at least one forename and at least one surname.</li>
        <li>You may not add a title such as Lord or Duke unless you can provide documentary proof of your entitlement
          to
          usage. &nbsp;Purchased titles are not accepted.
        </li>
        <li>Academic titles such as Professor will only be included if documentary proof is provided. &nbsp;Purchased
          qualifications will not be accepted.
        </li>
        <li>Amusing names can be accepted, but you should consider carefully if this will have consequences in your
          personal or professional life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The conditions listed above are guidelines and the acceptance or refusal of a name is at the discretion of
        the
        Registering Officer.</p>

      <h2>Do I really need to change my name by deed poll?</h2>

      <p>In theory, you could change your name simply by starting to use a new one. This is called a name change by
        usage.&nbsp;The main problem with this method is that many organisations will only change your name if you
        produce substantial documentary evidence of the name change.</p>
      <p>There are times when a deed poll is not needed to change a name:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>After marriage or civil partnership. A woman who wants to change her surname to that of her husband uses
          her
          marriage certificate. A civil partner uses their civil partnership certificate to change their surname
        </li>
        <li>After divorce. A woman can revert to her maiden surname by using her decree absolute</li>
        <li>After being widowed. A woman reverting to her maiden name after being widowed can use her late husband’s
          death certificate together with her marriage certificate to change her name.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How do I apply for a deed poll?</h2>

      <p>You will need to book an appointment. Once you’ve booked your appointment your completed online application
        form will need to be printed and signed when you attend.</p>
