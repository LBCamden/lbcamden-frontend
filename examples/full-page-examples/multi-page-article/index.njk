        <h2>What happens next?</h2>

        <p>We will add your business to our food businesses public register. The public can then view the:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>name of the business (if any)</li>
          <li>address and telephone number</li>
          <li>type of business at each premises</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All other records are not publicly available.</p>

        <p>We will arrange a food safety inspection of your premises once you open for business. During this visit a
          risk
          assessment and rating will be completed.</p>

        <p>When carrying out the risk assessment we consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>potential hazards</li>
          <li>compliance with legislation</li>
          <li>confidence in management and control systems</li>
          <li>the significance of risks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Potential hazards are the:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>types of food involved and the method of handling them,</li>
          <li>the methods of processing and handling food</li>
          <li>type and number of consumers at risk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Compliance relates to how the food operation is conducted and the physical environment that this takes place
          in.</p>

        <p>All of these categories are given a score rating and this is totalled to determine how often we will inspect
          the
          premises.</p>
